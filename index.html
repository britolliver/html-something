    <h2>As A Kid</h2>
    <p>I have always been a little different from the rest of my siblings. I am actually the only sibling out of five that did not get the name of one my parents. My mother was a traveling nurse when I was young and i loved it. I loved seeing different places and meeting different people, but I did not like making close connections just to have to separate from them. Louisiana was great but many things led to me having the desire from a very young age to leave. I always knew I wouldn't stay forever. I was not the person who is in love with their city or, in my case, small town. Some reasons I wanted to leave were:
        <ol> The racism was terrible.</ol> <ol> Louisiana is way too small.</ol> <ol> I had to pay almost $400 for a driving class just to get my license.</ol> </p>
